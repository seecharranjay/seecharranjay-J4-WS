This declaration is not possible because a class can only inherit from one super class, and this is extending Mammal and Carnivore
To fix this you can make another file that extends Carnivore.

An interface in java is a specification of methods that must be defined when a class implements the interface.
In an abstract class is where features could be defined and over-written into sub classes. interface Emplyee would hold all the features an employee would have.
For example one of them could be pay.

```
public class LinkedList implements Stack, Queue {
  public LinkedList() {/*...*/}
  public void addToFront(int v) {/*...*/}
  public int rmFromFront() {/*...*/}
  public void addToBack(int v) {/*...*/}
  public void rmFromBack() {/*...*/}
  
  //FINISH HERE
  public void push(int v) {
    addToFront(v);
  }

  public int pop(){
    return rmFromFront();
  }

  public void enqueue(int v){
    addToBack(v);
  }

  public int dequeue() {
    return rmFromFront;
  }

  public int peek () {
    return head.value;
  }
  
}
```

replace all ints with T
```
public interface Stack<T> {
    void push(T v); 
    T pop();        
    T peek();       
}
```
